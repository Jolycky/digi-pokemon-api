# digi-pokemon-api
 The repository demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using Node.js to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a dataset of Pokémon. The application could either interact with an existing PokeAPI (a popular public API that provides Pokémon data) or use a custom dataset hosted within the project.
